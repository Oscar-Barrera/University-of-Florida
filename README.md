This study used a simulated time-series dataset to analyze the normalized relative brightness of a star as an exoplanet passes in front of it. The light curve revealed a periodic ‘dip’ in luminosity, corresponding to the times when the planet is directly obscuring the light from the star. Assuming prior knowledge of stellar properties and exoplanet mass, the analysis of the data included the determination of the period of the exoplanet, the depth of the transit, the radius of the exoplanet, the duration of the transit, the semi-major axis of the exoplanet and the star, the velocity of the exoplanet and the star, the inclination, the density of the exoplanet, and the equilibrium temperature of the exoplanet. To improve the measurements, the data was sliced and folded.

In depth report in Cryptography.pdf

Using MCMC methods, the algorithm decrypted “jack and jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water” to ‘jack and jill rent um the hill to fetch a mail of rates,’ a phrase that achieved 91% accuracy. This was based on a random substitution cipher that was fed into the system as “zywdynfzmbboanxjrxiaimbbxpgaxwiyrymbpgoyxal.” To decrypt, the MCMC algorithm scored each proposed solution on a bi-gram probability matrix, along with referencing a dictionary to weigh solutions which matched words in the English Language. The solution converged after ~2000 iterations.

GW190521 was the most massive black hole merger discovered by LIGO/Virgo so far, with masses in tension with stellar evolution models. A possible explanation of such heavy black holes is that they themselves are the remnants of previous mergers of lighter black holes. While this is the most likely candidate for a hierarchical formation, other studies of gravitational waves have revealed black holes with similar masses. Here we estimate the hierarchical plausibility  of black hole mergers with the aid of machine learning algorithms (random forest).
