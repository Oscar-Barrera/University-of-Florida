# BlackHoles

Term Project - Shows a Machine Learning program to determine hierarchical plausibility of Black Hole mergers.


GW190521:

  Graphs Overleaf - Published Graphs for GW190521 merger
	
  Recreate GW190521 - random sample merger from m1 and m2 to confirm the formulas were correct
	
  Second Generation Probability - Reverse Engineered parameters for second generation
	
  90 Percent - Find 90% confidence interval ranges for Black Holes
	
  Deconstructed - Compare own formula to NASA / LIGO data
	
  LIGO Data - Deconstruct parameters from LIGO's data
	
  
	
	
DATA:

  g2 generation - second generation probability (not from published formula)
	
  Astrophysical Distribution - compute probabilities from prior distribution of Black Hole masses
	
  Check - check that formula constructs to proper parameters
	
  GW190521 spin - compute spin parameters and check their significance in relation to mass
	
  log scale - plot different parameters in log space and see any correlation
