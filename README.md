GW190521 was the most massive black hole merger discovered by LIGO/Virgo so far, with masses in tension with stellar evolution models. A possible explanation of such heavy black holes is that they themselves are the remnants of previous mergers of lighter black holes. While this is the most likely candidate for a hierarchical formation, other studies of gravitational waves have revealed black holes with similar masses. Here we estimate the hierarchical plausability of black hole mergers by
